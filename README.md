# Detection-of-11-sequence-using-Moore-FSM
In this project I have tried to build a Finite State Machine (FSM) using Xilinx Vivado 2016.3 . This system is implemented on  Zynq - 7000 development board. Using basic TCL commands and scripting implementation is done. It is a work in progress and will try to add constraints and generate bitstream as well.
